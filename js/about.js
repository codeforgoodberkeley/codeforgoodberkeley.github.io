Instructions for adding team member data from a google form:

We assume that the data is arranged in columns: Name | Email | LinkedIn | Role | Picture | Bio

If not already done, select the picture link of all new entries, right click, and select Smart Chips -> File.

Select and copy the relevant rows for the aforementioned 6 columns (name to bio).

Paste this data in a new line inside the data_strings array. (Works best in my VSCode if this is pasted in a line with no indentation)

Add quotation marks onto the beginning and end of each new line and add commas to the ends of each line.
    \-> this can be done in VSCode by selecting the start of the lines with Alt + click or Alt + Shift + click, and then getting to the end of the lines by navigating left and one down
Make sure to add a comma to the string before the one(s) you pasted in.

If applicable, run any HEIC files through this converter:
https://heictojpg.com/ or https://www.iloveimg.com/convert-to-jpg
Don't update the file names in the strings, this will be done automatically. 

Go to the form's image folder in google drive (can be accessed through the form) and then download all images.
Go to https://redketchup.io/bulk-image-resizer and "Resize By File Size" to have "Max. File Size 200KB" and download all. This is to ensure that the website loads quickly.
Upload all the images to the images/[SEMESTER]team folder (respective semester's folder).

If images are not centered, crop them to be centered around the face:
